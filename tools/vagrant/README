Local setup instructions:
========================
Run ./setup.sh

* Pre-reqs:
-----------
-- VirtualBox > 5.0
Vagrant > 1.8:
  - vagrant-vbguest (0.12.0) - useful to have (vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest)


===========================================================================================================================
==================================== Manual steps ========================================================================
===========================================================================================================================
* Work-dir:  tools/vagrant/docker/
----------
This is the folder in the git repo you just downloaded (git clone https://github.com/RetailMeNotSandbox/dart.git)
You can copy it to a separate folder, it has no dependency on the rest of the repo files.

Explanation of script's commands:
--------------------------------
0. (In tools/vagrant/docker/) python generate_deployment_files.py
  -- Generates Docker-compose, dockerfiles and config files from jinja templates.
  -- Any alterations you want to do to names/port will be done in generate_deployment_files.py

1. vagrant up (In tools/vagrant)
  -- We build a VM (Using vagrant => vagrant up) that will have docker tools installed and other useful pre-reqs.
  -- Make sure vagrant-triggers is installed.

2. vagrant ssh
  -- We will install additional docker related pre-reqs (we do not do it in the vagrant script since after creating then docker group we need to logout/login), after
     logging in to newly created VM.

3. ~/additional_steps.sh
  -- The script launches docker-compose that launches dart-web, dart-postgresql and dart-elastic (elasticmq) as well as the trigger/subscription and engine workers.
  -- we also populate the local database and run the unit-tests.
     -- This step might fail and might need to be run manually (just copy paste from ~/additional_steps.sh)

     ===========================================================================================================================

     1. Log in to the virtual box with the default vagrant/vagrant login.
     2. run chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


===========================================================================================================================
=================================== Local-development =====================================================================
===========================================================================================================================
1. The setup script git clones the repo to its local directory.
  -- It is the same repo that is mounted on the vagrant machine and mounted as a volume to all the (dart-workers) docker containers.
  -- You can edit the code in this repo and expect to see changes in UI.

2. If you need to relaunch a container.
   -- make sure you relaunch it with --build (e.g. in vagrant machine: cd /vagrant_data/docker_files; docker-compose up -d --build web)
      - Sometime you need to rerun the server.py for the web worker.
   -- In cases where you changed the docker-compose files (e.g. volumes, ports ...)
      - Make sure to delete all docker images before rebuilding (docker images; docker rmi <image-id>)

===========================================================================================================================
=================================== Troubleshooting =======================================================================
===========================================================================================================================
1. Make sure no other VM runs with the same name.

2. Make sure no other VM/pychram process holds a port - 5000 (5432, 9324)

3. dart-postgres: AttributeError: 'ProjectError' object has no attribute 'msg' ==> A docker container already holds port 5432 (docker-compose ps)

4. When you want to rebuild a docker image with new files - make sure you 1. docker-compose kill, 2.docker-compose rm and docker rmi <image>.
   - The do docker-compose up <name from docker-compose.yaml>
